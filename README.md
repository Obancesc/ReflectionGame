# ReflectionGameFinal
We didn't use GitHub as our primary version control since some of us did not know how to use it or had issues.
So what we ended up doing was email each other the assets and each draft/ version of the game.
It was easier for us this way as we told each other on our group chat. We did make a GitHub in the end to keep a record of
our game progress.
ReflectionDraftFinal/ReflectionDraft7 (This is our final version of the game within the GitHub branches)
